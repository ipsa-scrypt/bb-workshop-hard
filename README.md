## Introduction
Big Brain is a large project where we have to deal with LLM (large language models) and NLP (natural language processing).
<br>
In this version of the workshop, we are going to deal directly with neural networks.
<br>
We will use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to do sentiment analysis. Where we will use a common dataset in NLP: the IMDB, Amazon cells and yelp labelled dataset.

## Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is a task that consists in determining the sentiment of a text. For example, if we have the following sentence:
<br>
`I love this workshop!`
<br>
The sentiment of this sentence is positive. On the other hand, if we have the following sentence:
<br>
`I hate this workshop!`
<br>
The sentiment of this sentence is negative.
